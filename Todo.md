# List of ideas/bug fixes to be implemented:
## Multiple Accounts support
## Add spare account option
After successfully sniping a name, switch to another account since the current one can't change it's name again for the next 30 days
## Automatic 24/7 sniping
Useful if you are not using bearers which expire every 24h
- Option to snipe a list of chosen names [DONE]
- Option to snipe every 3 letter name [DONE]
- Option to snipe every english name (maybe possible)
## Better navigation
Make it so that pressing `Esc` while in either `Microsoft Account` or `Bearer Token` prompts; goes back to choosing one of the prompts again
