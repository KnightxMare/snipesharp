# List of ideas to be implemented:
## Better navigation
Make it so that pressing `Esc` while in either `Mojang Account` or `Bearer Token` prompts; goes back to choosing one of the prompts again
## Discord Webhooks
Send a Discord Webhook once a name has been successfully sniped using snipesharp
- Include the users name in the webhook
- May include an image of the current skin equipped to the account which sniped the name
- Send webhook to custom webhook
- Option to send webhook to snipesharp discord as well
## Discord RPC
Implement Discord RPC to work while using the program
## Auto skin change
Automatically change to a given skin on the authenticated account after successfully sniping a name
## Mojang Login
Implement Mojang Authentication & sniping with Mojang credentials
