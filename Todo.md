# List of ideas/bug fixes to be implemented:
## Fix selection prompt bugs
Make selection prompt self erase after completion and in the case of exiting the program during a selection prompt, erase a few lines to clear the screen of the selection prompt
## Automatic offset
Determine the best offset based on users ping to the name change API server
- Make it absolutely impossible to snipe too early using the automatic offset since this would be a complete miss
## Automatic 24/7 sniping
Useful if you are not using bearers which expire every 24h
- Option to snipe a list of chosen names
- Option to snipe every 3 letter name
- Option to snipe every english name
## Better navigation
Make it so that pressing `Esc` while in either `Mojang Account` or `Bearer Token` prompts; goes back to choosing one of the prompts again
## Discord RPC
Implement Discord RPC to work while using the program
## Mojang Login
Implement Mojang Authentication & sniping with Mojang credentials
