# List of ideas/bug fixes to be implemented:
## Encrypt account.json
Add a config.json option which when enabled encrypts the account.json file. This would be disabled by default.
## Automatic 24/7 sniping
Useful if you are not using bearers which expire every 24h
- Option to snipe a list of chosen names [DONE]
- Option to snipe every 3 letter name
- Option to snipe every english name
## Better navigation
Make it so that pressing `Esc` while in either `Mojang Account` or `Bearer Token` prompts; goes back to choosing one of the prompts again
## Discord RPC
Implement Discord RPC to work while using the program
## Mojang Login
Implement Mojang Authentication & sniping with Mojang credentials
